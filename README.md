# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch. The goal is to provide clear and concise implementations that serve as educational resources and allow for a deeper understanding of these algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- K-Means
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Dependencies (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manibp/ML-algorithms-from-scratch.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd machine-learning-algorithms

3. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python script within the corresponding directory. You can run the scripts individually to see the algorithms in action.
